They constantly beat in a coordinated motion, moving mucus and trapped particles upward towards the throat, where they can be swallowed or coughed out. This process helps to filter the air we breathe and protect the lungs from infection.\n\n**Incorrect options:**\n\n* **a) Alveoli:** Alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. \n* **b) Bronchioles:** Bronchioles are small airways that branch off from the bronchi and lead to the alveoli. \n* **d) Diaphragm:** The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle that helps with breathing by contracting and expanding the chest cavity. \n","1":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following is NOT a component of a eukaryotic cell?\n\na) Nucleus\nb) Ribosomes\nc) Cell Wall\nd) Golgi Apparatus\n\n## Answer:\n\n**c) Cell Wall**\n\n## Explanation:\n\nWhile cell walls are present in plant, fungal, and bacterial cells, they are **not** found in eukaryotic cells like animal cells.

The respiratory system also plays a role in sound production (through the larynx) and filtration of air (through the nasal cavity and other structures).  While the respiratory system can contribute to temperature regulation through panting and sweating, this is not its primary function. This is primarily handled by the skin and circulatory system. \n","165":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following is **NOT** a component found in all cells?\n\na) Plasma membrane\nb) Ribosomes\nc) Nucleus\nd) Cytoplasm\n\n## Answer:\n\n**c) Nucleus**\n\n## Explanation:\n\nWhile most cells possess a nucleus, some **prokaryotic cells** (like bacteria) lack a true nucleus.

The thin walls of the alveoli allow oxygen from inhaled air to diffuse into the surrounding capillaries, while carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* **Bronchi:**  These are large airways that conduct air to and from the lungs.\n* **Trachea:** This is the windpipe, the main airway that connects the larynx to the bronchi.\n* **Diaphragm:** This is a muscle that helps with breathing by contracting and relaxing to change the volume of the chest cavity. \n","979":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following organelles is responsible for producing energy (ATP) within a cell?\n\na) Nucleus\nb) Mitochondria\nc) Golgi apparatus\nd) Endoplasmic reticulum\n\n## Answer:\n\n**b) Mitochondria**\n\n## Explanation:\n\nMitochondria are often referred to as the \"powerhouses of the cell\" because they are responsible for cellular respiration, the process of converting glucose into ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. \n\n* **Nucleus:** Stores the cell's genetic material (DNA).\n* **Golgi apparatus:** Processes and packages proteins.\n* **Endoplasmic reticulum:**  A network of membranes involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism. \n","98":"","980":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following structures is **not** directly involved in the process of gas exchange in the human respiratory system?\n\na) Alveoli\nb) Bronchioles\nc) Trachea\nd) Capillaries\n\n## Answer:\n\n**c) Trachea**\n\n## Explanation:\n\nThe trachea, or windpipe, is responsible for transporting air to and from the lungs. It is a passageway that is not directly involved in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the bloodstream. This process occurs in the tiny air sacs called alveoli, where the thin walls allow for the diffusion of gases across the capillary network. \n","981":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following is NOT a function of the cell membrane?\n\na) Regulating the passage of substances into and out of the cell.\nb) Providing structural support and shape to the cell.\nc) Producing energy for the cell.\nd) Receiving and transmitting signals from the environment.\n\n## Answer:\n\n**c) Producing energy for the cell.**\n\n## Explanation:\n\nThe cell membrane is responsible for maintaining the cell's internal environment, regulating what enters and exits the cell, and responding to signals from the surrounding environment. While the cell membrane plays a crucial role in cellular processes, producing energy is the primary function of the mitochondria, not the cell membrane. \n","982":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following structures is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air in the lungs?\n\n**(a)** Bronchi \n**(b)** Alveoli\n**(c)** Trachea\n**(d)** Diaphragm\n\n## Correct Answer:\n\n**(b)** Alveoli\n\n## Explanation:\n\nAlveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs that are surrounded by capillaries. The thin walls of the alveoli and the capillaries allow for the efficient diffusion of oxygen from the inhaled air into the blood and carbon dioxide from the blood into the air to be exhaled.\n\n**Incorrect Answers:**\n\n* **(a) Bronchi:** Bronchi are the large tubes that carry air to and from the lungs.\n* **(c) Trachea:** The trachea is the windpipe, which carries air to the lungs.\n* **(d) Diaphragm:** The diaphragm is a muscle that helps with breathing by changing the volume of the chest cavity. \n","983":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following is NOT a characteristic of a prokaryotic cell?\n\n**(a)**  Absence of a nucleus\n**(b)** Presence of ribosomes\n**(c)**  Presence of membrane-bound organelles\n**(d)**  Presence of a cell wall\n\n**Correct answer:** (c) Presence of membrane-bound organelles\n\n**Explanation:** Prokaryotic cells, like bacteria and archaea, are characterized by the absence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. They have ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis, and often have a cell wall for structural support.  The lack of internal membrane compartments distinguishes them from eukaryotic cells. \n","984":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following structures is responsible for gas exchange in the human respiratory system?\n\na) Trachea\nb) Bronchi\nc) Alveoli\nd) Diaphragm\n\n## Answer:\n\n**(c) Alveoli**\n\n## Explanation:\n\nAlveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs that are surrounded by capillaries. The thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries allow for the diffusion of oxygen from the inhaled air into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. \n\nThe trachea, bronchi, and diaphragm play important roles in the respiratory system, but they are not directly involved in gas exchange. The trachea acts as a passageway for air, the bronchi branch off from the trachea to carry air to the lungs, and the diaphragm is a muscle that helps control breathing. \n","985":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following structures is NOT found in both plant and animal cells?\n\n**(a)** Cell membrane\n**(b)** Nucleus\n**(c)** Cell wall\n**(d)** Ribosomes\n\n## Correct Answer:\n\n**(c)** Cell wall\n\n## Explanation:\n\nPlant cells possess a rigid cell wall made of cellulose that provides structural support and protection. Animal cells, on the other hand, lack a cell wall. The remaining options are common to both plant and animal cells:\n\n* **Cell membrane:**  The outer boundary of all cells that regulates the passage of substances in and out.\n* **Nucleus:**  Contains the cell's genetic material (DNA).\n* **Ribosomes:**  Responsible for protein synthesis. \n","986":"## Question:\n\nWhich of the following structures is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air in the lungs?\n\n**(a)** Trachea\n**(b)** Bronchi\n**(c)** Alveoli\n**(d)** Diaphragm\n\n## Answer:\n\n**(c) Alveoli**\n\n## Explanation:\n\nAlveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs that are surrounded by capillaries.
